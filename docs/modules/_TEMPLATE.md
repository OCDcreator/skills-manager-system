# {Module Name}

> **Source**: `{source-path}`
> **Status**: [DRAFT]

## Overview

Explain what this module owns and why it exists.

## Import Relationships

```text
Upstream: ...
Downstream: ...
```

## Public Surface

List key exports, classes, functions, constants, commands, or types.

| Export | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `example` | ... |

## Core Logic

Describe the module's meaningful behavior. For types/constants/barrels/locales, rewrite this as “Export Semantics”, “Aggregation Rules”, or “Key Space”.

## Data Flow

Describe how data enters, is transformed, and leaves this module. Write “Not applicable” for pure type or aggregation modules.

## Interactions

Name the modules, settings, i18n keys, Tauri commands, or filesystem locations that must stay in sync with this one.

## Configuration

List related settings, environment variables, feature flags, or build-time inputs. Write “None” if absent.

## Change Notes

Document traps, invariants, and files to check when changing this module.

## Remaining Work

- [ ] Replace placeholder content after initial generation.

## Template Notes

- Use `[DRAFT]`, `[REVIEW]`, or `[FINAL]`.
- The coverage guard enforces presence and deletion sync; reviewers still enforce semantic accuracy.
- Prefer short, factual docs over long restatements of source code.
